I am a postdoc researcher at the Japan Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Tokyo, Japan. Before coming to Tokyo I did a first postdoc at the CRIL lab in Lens, France for two years. I completed my PhD in October 2021 after three years in the IRIT lab in Toulouse, France under the supervision of Andreas Herzig and Emiliano Lorini. Before that, I was a "normalienne" student of the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, and obtained my master's degree with the LMFI (Logique Mathématique et Fondements de l'Informatique, Mathematical Logic and Foundations of Computer Science) program at Paris Diderot University (now Paris Cité University).
